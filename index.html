    <div class="width50 ml50 smalltext mt100">Rather than an activity with a clear outcome, design has also become a medium itself, a system of signs. From economic flows and legal infrastructures to interfaces, virtual addresses and augmented realities, we are dealing with another type of world that generates economic value from information, fictional, false, or real. </div>
    <div class="width25 ml50 smalltext mt100">The stacks of information technology designed to blur geographic, economic, and political layers. In the face of these evolutions, how is our consciousness, cognition, and body affected?</div>

        <div class="width25 ml50 smalltext mt100">It seems algorithms on the loose govern us. We are the voluntary captives of the cloud. <br> <br> Design has become a ghost up in the air. In this system of invisible processes, our bodies also count as information. Filter bubbles are introduced to manage and predict our behaviour. Captcha software turns people into sophisticated sensory constituents; biometric capture technologies manage our identities. Siri and other virtual assistants trick us into falling in love with “them”; while bots and trolls influence how we think and act. </div>
